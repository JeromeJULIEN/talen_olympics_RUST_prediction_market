## Testable project

As i didn't have the time to develop a front end, you would be able to test the project on solpg [here](https://beta.solpg.io/66940b42cffcf4b13384d23b)

## How it work

Very unfinished work, sorry for that

- 1 - User create an user_account (PDA) and deposit fund into it
- 2 - Admin need to create e token_account(PDA) including the ticker and the price
- 3 - User create a bet
- 4 - Admin simulate a price variation by changing the token price in the associated PDA
- 5 - User check is bet. If i won't the money paid for the bet is send to his wallet (yes, he doesn't win more than he paid...:)

## Test
